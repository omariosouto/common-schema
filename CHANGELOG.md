# 1.0.4-beta20254211745263119PR3 - 2025-4-21

Adding support to:
- Throws `SchemaError`, always when using `parseSchema`
- When you are testing, you need to have fake data, for that use `generate` from the `/test` scope


# 1.0.3 - 2025-4-21

Here I'm exposing this custom schema in a separated entrypoint to don't make the whole package be bigger just because of it.


# 1.0.2 - 2025-4-13

Just testing the beta releases


# 1.0.1 - 2025-4-13

Just testing the beta releases
